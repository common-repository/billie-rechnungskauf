About Billie:

Billie is the new standard for B2B payments. With its pioneering Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) solution, the Berlin-based
fintech allows business buyers to purchase goods now and flexibly defer payment to a time that suits their individual
needs best––whether they shop online, in-store, via phone or email. At the same time, merchants get paid upfront while
benefiting from full payment default risk protection as well as higher conversion rates and basket sizes in their
checkout.

Billie is the B2B BNPL solution of choice for established brands and ambitious growth companies. To date, more than
400,000 business customers have already paid via Billie.
